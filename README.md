# FoodAppKivyKubernetess
This app is using Kivy framework for the frontend and for the backend i use 2 containers: Flask+ Mongo inside a Kubernetes cluster 

There are some instruction that will help you to implement the backend really fast in /flask-backend/flask-mongo-auxiliar/

For the app side you should start by installing the app/requirements.txt ---- pip install -r requirements.txt -- after you can run food.py --- python food.py

If you have questions you can ask me and i will try to udate this readme
